Sandbox for BossyUI Directives
===

## To Prep

From your local repo root, run: `gulp build-sandbox` (you might need to run `npm install` if you havn't in a while).  

## To Launch
 
CD to sites/sandbox: `cd sites/sandbox`.  Open with your faviorte micro web server, ie: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
The page will read-up all the directives current to bossy.all.js, and give you a list to pick from.  Clicking on 'Open 
in JSFiddle' will launch a fiddle with the directive as would be used.

## Notes

The sandbox should only be used to test your developed directive as it would be used.  It is not met as a development 
environment.
